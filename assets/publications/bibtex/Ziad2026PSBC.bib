abstract = {Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) assessment in melanoma histopathology is critical for predicting immunotherapy response and improving patient outcomes, yet current automated segmentation methods are severely constrained by limited datasets and pronounced class imbalance. We present a novel dual-generator adversarial framework that revolutionizes synthetic histopathology data generation by decomposing the complex synthesis problem into two specialized sequential tasks: controllable mask generation with user-specified class distributions, followed by high-fidelity histopathology image synthesis. This innovative approach enables precise dataset augmentation with any desired number of tissue classes per image, fundamentally addressing the scarcity of balanced training data. Leveraging the PUMA Grand Challenge dataset, we systematically generated two complementary datasets and evaluated them using a custom U-Net architecture that integrates a powerful MedSAM encoder with a specialized decoder optimized for fine-grained tissue segmentation. Our dual-GAN framework demonstrates exceptional capability in generating photorealistic histopathology images while maintaining precise control over tissue class distributions and spatial relationships. The proposed architecture achieved outstanding performance with an F1 score of 0.91 on the PUMA dataset and new data from the three-class per-image dataset, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in melanoma tissue segmentation. This scalable framework establishes a new paradigm for computational pathology, enabling robust TIL assessment and enhanced clinical decision-making in melanoma management.}

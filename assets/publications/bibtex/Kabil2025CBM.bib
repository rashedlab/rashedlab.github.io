abstract = {Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) stands as a cornerstone in medical image analysis, playing a pivotal role in precise diagnostics, treatment planning, and monitoring of various medical conditions. This paper presents a comprehensive and systematic survey of MIS methodologies, bridging the gap between traditional image processing techniques and modern deep learning approaches. The survey encompasses thresholding, edge detection, region-based segmentation, clustering algorithms, and model-based techniques while also delving into state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), and the widely adopted U-Net and its variants. Moreover, integrating attention mechanisms, semi-supervised learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and Transformer-based models is thoroughly explored. In addition to covering established methods, this survey highlights emerging trends, including hybrid architectures, cross-modality learning, federated and distributed learning frameworks, and active learning strategies, which aim to address challenges such as limited labeled datasets, computational complexity, and model generalizability across diverse imaging modalities. Furthermore, a specialized case study on lumbar spine segmentation is presented, offering insights into the challenges and advancements in this relatively underexplored anatomical region. Despite significant progress in the field, critical challenges persist, including dataset bias, domain adaptation, interpretability of deep learning models, and integration into real-world clinical workflows. This survey serves as both a tutorial and a reference guide, particularly for early-career researchers, by providing a holistic understanding of the landscape of MIS and identifying promising directions for future research. Through this work, we aim to contribute to the development of more robust, efficient, and clinically applicable medical image segmentation systems.}

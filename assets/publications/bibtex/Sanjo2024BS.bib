ABSTRACT = {An electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to observe the electrical activity of the heart via electrodes on the body surface. Recently, an ECG with fewer electrodes, such as a bipolar ECG in which two electrodes are attached to the chest, has been employed as wearable devices. However, the effect of different geometrical factors and electrode-pair locations on the amplitude and waveform of ECG signals remains unclear. In this study, we computationally evaluated the effects of body morphology, heart size and orientation, and electrode misalignment on ECG signals for 48 scenarios using 35 bipolar electrode pairs (1680 waveforms) with a dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm. It was observed that the physique of the human body model predominantly affected the amplitude and waveform of the ECG signals. A multivariate analysis indicated that the heart–electrode distance and the solid angle of the heart from the electrode characterized the amplitude and waveform of the ECG signals, respectively. Furthermore, the electrode locations for less individual variability and less waveform distortion were close to the location of electrodes V2 and V3 in the standard 12-lead. These findings will facilitate the placement of ECG electrodes and interpretation of the measured ECG signals for wearable devices.},

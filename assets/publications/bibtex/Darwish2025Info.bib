ABSTRACT = {The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to substantial investment in enhancing their capabilities and expanding their feature sets. Despite these developments, a critical gap remains between model sophistication and their dependable deployment in real-world applications. A key concern is the inconsistency of LLM-generated outputs in production environments, which hinders scalability and reliability. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates custom-defined, rule-based logic to constrain and guide LLM behavior effectively. This framework enforces deterministic response boundaries while considering the model’s reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a quantitative performance scoring mechanism that achieves an 85.5% improvement in response consistency, facilitating more predictable and accountable model outputs. The proposed system is industry-agnostic and can be generalized to any domain with a well-defined validation schema. This work contributes to the growing research on aligning LLMs with structured, operational constraints to ensure safe, robust, and scalable deployment.},
